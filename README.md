1. Set Up Your Development Environment
Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed. You can download it from the Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
Set Up Maven (Optional but Recommended): Maven can manage dependencies and build your project. Download and install it from Apache Maven.
Install Selenium WebDriver: You can download the Selenium WebDriver JAR files from Selenium's official website.
Install Browser Driver: Depending on the browser you are using (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), download the corresponding driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome) from their respective sources.

2. Create a Maven Project (If Using Maven)
Create a new Maven project and add the Selenium dependency to your pom.xml file:

3. Write the Selenium Test Script
Here's a basic example of how you might write a Selenium script in Java to interact with a website. This example assumes you want to navigate to a performance page, capture some metrics, and then log them.(Amazon.java)

4. Handle Dynamic Content and Authentication
If the performance page requires login or dynamic content loading, you will need to handle those cases:

Login Handling: Use Selenium to interact with login fields and submit the form.
Wait for Elements: Use WebDriverWait to wait for elements to be present or visible.(Hdca.java)
5. Capture Performance Metrics
To measure performance, you might need additional tools or browser features, such as:

Chrome DevTools Protocol: For more detailed performance metrics, consider using the Chrome DevTools Protocol.
Third-Party Libraries: Look into libraries like WebPageTest or Lighthouse for in-depth performance analysis.

6. Respect Website Policies
Ensure that your automation respects Amazonâ€™s terms of service and robots.txt file. Excessive or unauthorized scraping might lead to legal issues or getting blocked.
